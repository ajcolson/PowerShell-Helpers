# PowerShell Helpers
 An assorted collection of some helpful PowerShell scripts used in daily troublsehooting life of an IT support provider.

 ## About
 Most of these scripts started life out as a quick fix for a particular problem or need while working to solve IT support related problems. I'm sharing these here both as a repository for collegues I've worked with and as toolkit for myself in future endeavors. :smile:

 Some scripts may require a bit of modication if you want to run them yourself, such as those referencing specific resources on a network, like a workstation hostname or server.

 ## Disclaimer
 Although these scripts o be job aids to IT technicians, as with all scripts you find from the Internet, please exercise caution when running these scripts. Before running these in your production enviroments, be sure to consult with your company's security department to ensure running local scripts is permitted. :innocent:
